## Important Note on Environment

During development, we encountered persistent build issues related to CSS processing (specifically involving PostCSS and attempts to process Tailwind CSS even after removal). These issues were resolved by ensuring a clean environment and potentially relate to Node.js version compatibility.

It is strongly recommended to use a **Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support)** version (e.g., v20.x as of early 2025) for the most stable experience. If you encounter build errors, try:

*   Ensuring you are on an LTS Node version (use `nvm` to manage versions).
*   Performing a very clean install: `rm -rf node_modules && rm -f package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force && npm install`.

## Development

*   The main application logic is in `src/pages/MoodPupMain.tsx`.
*   Reusable UI elements are in `src/components/`.
*   State management hooks are in `src/hooks/`.
*   Utility functions (like emotion analysis) are in `src/utils/`.
